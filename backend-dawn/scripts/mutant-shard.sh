# Shared sharding and coverage bookkeeping for the mutation harnesses.
# Sourced, never executed. Callers must have set `set -euo pipefail`.
#
# Why sharding exists: the matrices outgrew a single CI job. 125 mutants at
# ~52s each is 108 minutes serial, and on 2026-08-14 that ran past the backend
# job's 62-minute budget and got the run cancelled mid-matrix. Measured on the
# same day, the per-mutant cost is 5.9s of `dawn build` (236% CPU) and 38.4s of
# `dawn test` (41% CPU) — so a mutant spends most of its wall clock not using a
# core, and splitting across jobs buys almost the full factor.
#
# Selection is `index % shard_total == shard_index`, not contiguous blocks:
# mutants are not equal cost (a `contract`-role mutant boots a server, a `test`
# one does not) and the expensive ones cluster in the matrix file, so blocks
# would leave one shard carrying the run.
#
# The coverage file is the part that matters. A shard that silently skipped
# half its mutants prints the same PASS lines and exits 0 exactly like one that
# did the work, so nothing downstream could tell them apart. Every run therefore
# writes down which mutants it actually executed, and scripts/mutants_coverage.py
# reassembles the shards in CI and holds their union against `mutate.py --list`.
# That comparison is against the source of truth, not against a count the shards
# report about themselves — a shard cannot vouch for its own completeness.

# puts the function in a subshell, where a bad `--shard` would print its
